"""
Searches for duplicate data in MCE files.

In particular, scan up to 10000 readout frames of an MCE file and
identify indices in frame n-1 that are always duplicated at some fixed
index in frame n.

For example, the last 6 samples in a readout frame might always be
repeated as the first 6 samples of the next frame.  This would be reported as:

    Filename: noise300_r20c12_b600_noise
     readout size:      256
     duplicate runs:      1
          length   prev_frame  frame
